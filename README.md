# RPM: A Music Discussion Forum
<hr />
# Introduction

During my time at Nova Scotia Community CollegeInspired by Aquarium Forum, https://www.aquariumforum.com/, this project is a discussion thread forum built using ASP.NET MVC design pattern. There is a relatively simple database implemented using Entity Framework ORM. 



<hr />
# Description


Create a thread and start talking about your favourite records right away! All you need is
an image of an album cover, a title, some content, and that's it. You can create, edit, and delete a thread. There are comments as well! The comments are on the discussion details page, organized by the date they were created.

<hr />

This project is a work-in-progress music discussion forum highlighting my ASP.NET skills. 
As with all of my projects, I will be continuing development post-school. So feel free to check back to see the progress as time goes on.



Thank you for checking it out.
